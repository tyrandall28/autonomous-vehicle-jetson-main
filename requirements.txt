# Optimized Vision System Requirements for Jetson Nano
# Install with: pip3 install -r requirements_optimized.txt

# Core vision libraries
opencv-python>=4.5.0
numpy>=1.19.0

# TensorRT inference (pre-installed on Jetson)
# tensorrt>=8.0.0  # Usually pre-installed on JetPack

# CUDA support (pre-installed on Jetson)
# pycuda>=2021.1  # Install separately if needed
# pycuda needed to be installed for tensorrt to work and it would only install when installed in terminal via "pip install pycuda". No other combination of pip3 or python3 or -m tags or anything else worked.

# Optional monitoring tools
jetson-stats>=4.0.0  # For system monitoring with jtop

# Alternative lightweight models (optional)
# ultralytics>=8.0.0  # For downloading newer models

# For model conversion and optimization
# torch>=1.9.0  # If you need to export custom models
# torchvision>=0.10.0

# Threading and async support (built-in)
# No additional requirements for threading

# Performance monitoring
psutil>=5.8.0  # For system resource monitoring
